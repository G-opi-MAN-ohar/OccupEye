**OccupEye - Building Traffic and Animal Monitoring System**

We managed to perform the detection and surveillance operation using the latest version of YOLO, i.e., YOLOv8. The impact of YOLOv8 extends far beyond crowd management; it has ushered in a new era of computer vision applications. These applications have found their place in a myriad of public spaces, such as stadiums, airports, and event venues, ensuring that the safety and comfort of attendees are prioritized.

With all the efforts, we finally got the person detected, assigned with unique IDs, and counted when crossing the imaginary lines. The line of intersection phenomenon helps us determine whether the personnel entered or exited the building. All the sample images are represented below.

People are exiting the building rapidly within seconds, but our model is capable enough to keep an eye on every person on the way.
